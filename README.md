## 📦 What Is This?

This repository provides bundled releases containing multiple Tizen applications (`.wgt` files).  
Instead of downloading and installing each app individually, you can grab a single **bundle** that includes several community apps — ready for side-loading onto your Tizen devices.

Each release represents a curated collection of useful, fun, or open-source Tizen web apps.
